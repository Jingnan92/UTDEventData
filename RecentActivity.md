*PETRARCH2: A Python Engine for Text Resolution And Related Coding Hierarchy part 2. PETRARCH is a natural language processing tool for machine-coding events data. It is designed to process fully-parsed news summaries in Penn Treebank format, from which ‘whom-did-what-to-whom’ relations are extracted. For more information, please check this on [GitHub](https://petrarch2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).


*UD Petrarch: Code for the new Python Engine for Text Resolution And Related Coding Hierarchy (PETRARCH) event data coder. The coder now has all of the functions from the older TABARI coder and the new CAMEO.verbpatterns.140609.txt dictionary incorporates both parser-based matching and extensive synonym sets. The program coded 60,000 AFP sentences from the GigaWord corpus without crashing, using the included dictionaries. For more information, please visit the [documentation](https://petrarch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#).  

*Focus Locality Extraction: This repository provides a tool that helps to extract geolocations automatically from unstructured text-based news reports. For more details, please check this on [GitHub](https://github.com/openeventdata/Focus_Locality_Extraction).

*Mordecai: Full text geoparsing as a Python library. Extract the place names from a piece of text, resolve them to the correct place, and return their coordinates and structured geographic information. For more details, please check this on [GitHub](https://github.com/openeventdata/mordecai).
