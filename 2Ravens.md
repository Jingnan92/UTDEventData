TwoRavens for Event Data is a Web application designed for researchers to easily structure raw event data into usable time-series formats. Researchers can browse openly available event datasets, construct queries to select types of events and sets of actors, view and download resulting time-series data, and export data to our main system for AI assisted analysis.

Researchers interested in using TwoRavens for Event Data, or contributing novel data to the system, should contact Vito D'Orazio.

This application is part of the broader TwoRavens project. For more detail see [TwoRavens](https://tworavens.github.io/TwoRavens/EventData/).
