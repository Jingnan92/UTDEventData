TwoRavens for Event Data is a Web application designed for researchers to easily structure raw event data into usable time-series formats. Researchers can browse openly available event datasets, construct queries to select types of events and sets of actors, view and download resulting time-series data, and export data to our main system for AI assisted analysis.

This application is part of the broader TwoRavens project. For more detail see [TwoRavens](https://tworavens.github.io/TwoRavens/EventData/).
