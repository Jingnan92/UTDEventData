We are not going to host a local software repository at UT-Dallas; consistent with the OEDA goals we want to make this as general as possible across test, processing, data sets, and subsequent analyses.  Our goal is to generalize this as much as possible across data sets, data analysis tools, text processing tools, etc. for those interested in political text analysis. To see the software we have developed for this project see the following:

- [OPENEVENTDATA GitHub Site](https://github.com/openeventdata)
- Our [UTDEventData R package](https://github.com/KateHyoung/UTDEventData) for the real-time data and historical event data (this is a work in progress).
